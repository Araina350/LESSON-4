<h3>PARAGRAPH ON DOGS</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s a four legged animal which was originally bred from wolves. They make sounds such as bark, woof or arf. They have the ability to hear, smell and identify things very well but they have poor sight or to be specific, colour blindness, because of which they cannot see well in colour but can see better in dim light compared to humans. Dogs eat both meat and vegetarian food.</p>


<p>As these are friendly, loyal and like being around humans, they are the most preferred pets and also were the first animals ever to be domesticated.</p>
